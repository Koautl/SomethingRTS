        units cost 10 gold and are represented by a blue pixel, they match the speed of the enemy units and deal the same amount of damge which is 4. Tanks cost 25 gold, move half the speed as a melee but deal 10
        damage to the enmy hq. Tanks are represented by a purple pixel . Rangers cost 15 and deal 6 damage to enemy hq but don't have to get as close the tank or Melee, before doing damage. Rangers are represented by a blue pixel. The enemy units will deal more damage as the game goes
        on to keep games very short.
